Our project aims to design a practical, affordable, and self-sustaining off-grid electrical system utilizing readily available products. This final report re-examines our previously submitted requirements, makes necessary adjustments, compiles previous product cycles, analyzes costs, provides comprehensive vendor information, and ensures smooth installation. Our report will carefully scrutinize all project cycles, explore industry trends and advancements, and provide a thorough cost analysis. It will also provide a comprehensive vendor list and detailed safety measures, instructions for use and maintenance. Our marketing team will develop a robust marketing strategy to promote the product's unique features and benefits. Our goal is to ensure a safe, efficient, and commercially viable off-grid electricalÂ system.
