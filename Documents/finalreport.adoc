[[_abstract]]
== 3. Abstract
This report outlines the design of the mobile charger. The main aim is to prepare an effective charger. The process started with researching the essential requirements which include the input-output requirements, logistical requirements, environmental requirements, and structural requirements. Then the set of specifications is developed based on the requirements. The specifications are mentioned for the different parts of the charger like the adapter, master-control chip, cable, charger pins, power and safety, and finally the circuit specifications. Basic design ideas are discussed with help of some reference designs. 

Using the basic circuit idea and specifications, we have designed a final design for the charger considering the power ratings, size, cost, and other factors. The design process included the closure design and PCB model making.  To check the final circuit, simulations are performed, and calculated the required circuit parameters. Then worked on getting the circuit components with low cost and good efficiency along with their 3D models and footprints. The model of our designed circuit is made.
Finally, we have the charger which meets all the requirements and specifications at a good price. 

[[_motivation]]
== 4. Motivation
Redesign Inspirations :

We redesigned a phone charger as electrical engineers for numerous reasons. Some: 

* *Efficiency*: A phone charger change was motivated by efficiency. A more efficient charger could reduce energy wastage during charging, saving consumers money on their energy bills and helping the environment. 

* *Safety*: Redesigning a phone charger for safety was another reason. We aimed to reduce electrical shocks, overheating, and short circuits.

* *Compatibility*: Making the charger compatible with additional devices was another motive. We wanted to build a charger that works with Android and iOS devices or many devices at once.

* *Convenience*: For instance, we wanted to build a charger with a longer wire or a smaller, more compact design. 

* *Sustainability*: A phone charger innovation was driven by sustainability. Use eco-friendly materials or make the charger recyclable.

[[_input_output_requirements]]
=== 5.1. Input Output Requirements
* *Input*: Type C plug, 100-230V, 50-60Hz, 0.6 A.
* *Output*: 5V, 2Amp to 10V, 6.5Amp.Using USB Power Delivery (USB PD) it is
  a technology that allows for variable power output and flexible charging
  of devices.
  It also allows for reverse power flow, which means that a device can also
  charge another device or even a battery.
  A microcontroller can be used to control and regulate the charging
  process, in order to implement variable power output.
  PIC microcontrollers (ex.
  Linear Technology’s LTC4055, Texas Instruments’ bq2429x, Maxim
  Integrated’s MAX14526, NXP’s MC3467) are widely used in chargers due to
  their low cost, high performance, and easy-to-use programming.
* *Power requirement*: 10W to 100W.

[[_logistical_requirements]]
=== 5.2. Logistical Requirements
* *Packaging*: The charger should be packaged in a way that ensures it is
  protected from damage.
* *Durability*: Robust design to withstand frequent use and travel.
* *Portability*: For more portability, the LED light segment should be the
  first choice.
* *Labelling*: The charger should be clearly labelled with all relevant
  information, including the output voltage and amperage, safety warnings,
  and the name and contact information of the manufacturer.
* *Compliance*: The charger should comply with all relevant regulations and
  standards regarding storage, handling, and transportation.
  It should also be BIS(Bureau of Indian Standards) approved.
* *Laboratory and Testing*: To test the charger, we need testing equipment
  like DSO, multi-meter, power supply, function generator, and precision
  soldering tools.
  The components need to be tested to prevent breakdown.
* *Manufacturing*: The product has to be manufactured by a third
  manufacturer, or the body gets 3D printed in Lab.
* *Components*: We need step-down transformers, Diodes, capacitors,
  resistors, wires, transistors, and a PIC microcontroller.

[[_environmental_requirements]]
=== 5.3. Environmental Requirements
* *Temperature range*: -10℃ to 60℃.
* *Humidity*: Chargers must be able to operate in a range of humidity
  levels, typically between 20% and 90%.
* *Water resistant*: Charger’s edges and ports need to be rubber sealed, to
  prevent the circuit from water.
* *Altitude*: Chargers must be able to operate at a range of altitudes,
  typically up to 2,000 meters above sea level.
* *Shock and vibration*: Chargers must be able to withstand a certain level
  of shock and vibration without damage or malfunction.
* *EMI/EMC*: Chargers must meet electromagnetic interference (EMI) and
  electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards to ensure that they do not
  interfere with other electronic devices.
* *Safety Standards*: Chargers must meet safety standards to ensure that
  they do not pose a risk of fire or electric shock.
* *Energy efficiency*: Chargers must meet energy efficiency standards to
  minimize energy consumption and reduce environmental impact.
  Minimize No Load power consumption.

[[_structural_requirements]]
=== 5.4. Structural Requirements
* *Dimensions:* The Dimensions of the charger should be around
  (6cm*6cm*4cm).
* *Plug Type:* The charger should be *2-pin plug(Type C)* (2-pin plugs are
  widely used in India, but it is important to make sure it is BIS approved
  for safety and compliance)
* *Material and Design:* The *material* and design of the charger should be
  such that it should be able to withstand a fall from a height of 2m or
  less.
  Some people like to keep their mobile phones on top of the charger so
  adequate design changes should be made to the adapter.
  Also, we now need to make sure that the heat generated in the charger
  shouldn’t be transferred to the mobile phone, in that case, the material
  chosen should have better insulation properties than a standard one.
  For this polycarbonate, casing seems to be the best considering price,
  drop strength, and weight.
* *Adapter-cable joint:* The adapter-cable joint is made to disconnect when
  a jerk is applied quickly but to remain firmly attached otherwise,
  protecting the phone from damage during tripping.
* *Length of cable:* The length of the cable should range from 3 to 4 feet.
  The cable should be tangle free.
* *Wire thickness:* The wire in it should be thick enough to work at 65 W
  but not more than that.
  It should also have the option for sending data from computer to phone and
  vice versa(data cable).
  It should be durable enough such that even if someone treads on it, it
  remains safe and should also withstand a load of minimum 150N.
  It should be a USB 3.X cable with USB C type connector.
  To ensure we can charge a range of devices, it’s best to go with 2A ports
  at minimum.
* *Charger pins:* Pins should be made of a material that has low cost, good
  electrical resistivity, and good wear resistance.
  For this Brass seems to have a mix of all three properties and hence it
  should be used
* *Location of port:* It should be front rather than on the side after
  considering spacing (both in real life and along the board), aesthetics
* *Label Information:* Brand name and logo, Input and output voltage and
  current specifications, Type of connector, Compatibility, Safety
  certifications and standards (e.g., IBS), Product dimensions and weight,
  country of origin, instructions for use and safety precautions Warranty or
  guarantee information.
* *Casing Opening:* The charger case will open from the rear end, keeping
  the area near the pins fixed to ensure easy assembly.
  moreover, the transverse cross-section of the charger will be fixed to
  protect from dust and moisture and structural integrity

[[_features]]
=== 5.5. Features
* *Safety Features*: Over-current, over-voltage, and short-circuit
  protection.

[[_description]]
==== 6.2.1. Description
The UCC28740 isolated-flyback power-supply controller provides Constant-Voltage (CV) using an optical coupler to improve transient response to large-load steps. Constant-Current (CC) regulation is accomplished through Primary-Side Regulation (PSR) techniques. This device processes information from opto-coupled feedback and an auxiliary flyback winding for precise high-performance control of output voltage and current.

Control algorithms in the UCC28740 allow operating efficiencies to meet or exceed applicable standards. The drive output interfaces to a MOSFET power switch. Discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with valley-switching reduces switching losses. Modulation of switching frequency and primary current-peak amplitude (FM and AM) keeps the conversion efficiency high across the entire load and line ranges.

.Schematics of design 1

Even Though the above charger reference circuit has specifications like variable output (5V/3A to 20V/3A) , fast charging with USB PD protocol IC, 
The above circuit was a discarded attempt because:

* Due to the fact that IIT D makerspace can only construct single-layered PCBs, the size of the PCB for the above circuit will be fairly huge.
* The BOM(bill of materials) count for the above circuit is extremely high.
* The costs for the individual components are extremely high resulting the manufacturing of the charger will be extremely costly.

[[_design2]]
=== 8.1.1.2. Design 2
.Schematics of design 2
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/design2.jpg[]

The output of the above circuit is 9V at 3A, and the power supply circuit uses flyback topology. It was a failed attempt because:

* The PCB will be huge (total footprint area = 2534 mm2).
* High cost of manufacturing (cost > 1000 Rupees)
* The output of the above circuit is 9V with a maximum output current of 3A, but only a small number of mobile phones support this charging voltage. Hence, it will harm mobile phones that do not support charging at more than 5V.

[[_design3]]
=== 8.1.1.3. Design 3

.Schematics of design 3
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/design3.jpg[]
The output for the above circuit is 12V/2A and flyback topology is followed for the power supply circuit. But the above circuit was considered a discarded attempt because:

* The size of the PCB (total footprint area = 2636 mm^2) will be very large because of the same reason the above design was discarded.
*  Expensive fabrication(cost > 1200 Rs)
The output of the above circuit provides only a 12V output voltage with 3A max output current but only a limited number of mobile phones support charging at 12V. Hence charging mobile phones which do not support charging at more than 5V will get damaged.

[[_design4]]
=== 8.1.1.4. Design 4

.Schematics of design 4

The output for the above circuit is 9V/3A and flyback topology is followed for the power supply circuit. But it was considered a discarded attempt because:

* The output of the above circuit provides only a 9V output voltage with 3A max output current but only a limited number of mobile phones support charging at 9V. Hence charging mobile phones which do not support charging at more than 5V will get damaged.
* The circuit described above lacks optocoupler feedback. By regulating oscillator circuit frequency and galvanic isolation between the High voltage Primary side and the Low voltage Secondary side, the optocoupler circuit offers regulated output voltage.

We accept 220V AC as input (it can vary between 85-265V) with a frequency between 50-60 Hz and outputting 5V DC.

* From the flowchart, we can see that the input is rectified using a Full Wave Rectifier Bridge IC, which produces an output voltage with a variable DC voltage. The voltage signal is then sent to a Pi-Filter to allow the DC Component and block the AC Component of the Rectifier's output, where the Pi filter is constructed with two 22μF 50 mohm capacitors and a 470 μH 1.48-ohm inductor.

* This constant DC voltage is sent to a PWM controller circuit, which converts DC 78.78 kHz high-frequency AC with varying duty cycles for different input voltage and output current.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/ic%20temp%20vs%20output%20i.jpg[]

This high-frequency AC is achieved using an external high voltage switching transistor IPD 80R1K0CE TMA1 driven by a Gate signal provided by the DRV output of the isolated-flyback power-supply controller IC UCC28740. Using an optical coupler, the controller IC provides Constant-Voltage (CV) to improve transient response to large load steps. Primary-Side Regulation (PSR) techniques control Constant-Current (CC). This device processes data from optocoupler feedback and an auxiliary flyback winding for precise, high-performance output voltage and current control.

* After getting a high-frequency AC voltage from the PWM oscillator Circuit, this voltage is stepped down to a lower AC voltage using a transformer. The Transformer has three windings: Primary, Secondary, and Auxiliary. The Auxiliary winding is used to run the control circuit. The Secondary winding is connected to a Schottky diode B540C-13-F and a capacitor of 35V and 1.2 mF to convert AC to DC

.T1 i rms
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/T1%20i%20rms.jpg[]

* The Output of the rectified secondary voltage of the transformer is now connected to a feedback circuit containing an optocoupler PS2711-1  and a low voltage(1.24 V) adjustable precision shunt regulator IC LMV431. An Optocoupler is used for the transmission of feedback signals without contact. It has an infrared LED and a phototransistor. The feedback circuit provides the regulation of output at 5V. A Shunt voltage regulator regulates the voltage by shunting current away from the load to regulate the output voltage. Therefore, the load current becomes more prominent, maintaining the regulated voltage across the load.

=== 8.2. PCB Design
*Description* +

* We are using polygon pour on both sides LV for purpose of grounding. We have ensured that there is no island formation due to routing. All the grounds connections are properly ensured.

* We are using 6 port USB C which is specially made for the purpose of power transfer. 

* On the LV side, we are using 70 mil for purpose of power transfer as our current requirement is 3A. There are 2 pins each for ground and power. We are keeping their width as 35 mils. We are directly connecting the ground pins of the USB C to transformer such that, the ground polygon should be carrying this high amount of current. 

* On the HV side, we are using traces of width 10mils because the current passing through the circuit is very low. 

* We are having insulation between HV and LV side and their separate ground ensures insulation. 

* PCB is designed is such a manner that all the component of significant height are kept on one single side and other on different side of PCB. This is done to optimise space on the PCB.

[[_magnetic_scope]]
=== 11.1. Scope for magnetic cable
As we all know that, Magnetic charging cables are an incredibly useful accessory in our
daily lives. Not only are they extremely aesthetic additions, but they’re also capable of
adding a layer of protection for your phone and chord. Best of all, it’s perfectly safe for
your phone to use.

But in reality, we can't realize/construct magnetic cables at the level we are currently as students because these cables can be made only at the industrial level by the use of extremely highly mechanized/advanced machinery, for example, PCB fabrication can only be done at industrial level. 

So, theoretically the magnetic cable we hope to make will be having some following
features :

* The charging cable should support 360° + 180° rotation that ensures the cables move along with the phone in any direction. 



*  Most magnetic chargers come with three types of connectors such as Type C, Micro-USB, and Lightning. The first two in the list are useful to charge Android devices while the Lightning connector is used for iPhones. 

* The magnetic charger comes with a LED indicator. When the phone is charging, the LED indicator lights up. 

* We should also focus on symmetry , because it will be convenient , so don’t have to worry which side is up, definitely gonna attract customers, plus it can be the “WOW factor” of our product.
