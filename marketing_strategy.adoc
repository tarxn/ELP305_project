The USP is the unique benefit that BBChargers' products offer to customers that sets them apart from competitors.

The USP should be highlighted in all marketing communications to attract and retain customers.

=== Step 4: Develop the marketing mix

The marketing mix consists of four key elements: product, price, promotion, and place. BBChargers needs to develop a marketing mix that will appeal to its target audience.

*Product:* BBChargers should focus on developing high-quality 15-watt chargers that are durable and reliable. The design of the chargers should be sleek and stylish, with an emphasis on portability.

*Price:* BBChargers should price its products competitively, taking into consideration the cost of production and the prices of competitors.

*Promotion:* BBChargers should develop a promotional strategy that includes advertising, sales promotions, and public relations. The advertising campaign should highlight the USP of the chargers and the benefits of using them. Sales promotions such as discounts and special offers can be used to attract new customers. Public relations can be used to generate positive media coverage for the brand.

*Place:* BBChargers should make its products available in online stores and physical retail outlets, targeting locations where its target audience is likely to shop.

For example, BBChargers can create videos that show how its 15-watt chargers work and how they can improve the charging experience for customers.
