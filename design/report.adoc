[[_requirements]]
== 3. Requirements
In the following section, we have given various requirements for a phone
charger that we will need for our design.

.Requirements mindmap
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/img.jpg[]

[[_input_output_requirements]]
=== 3.1. Input Output Requirements
* *Input*: Type C plug, 100-230V, 50-60Hz, 0.6 A.
* *Output*: 5V, 2Amp to 10V, 6.5Amp.Using USB Power Delivery (USB PD) it is
  a technology that allows for variable power output and flexible charging
  of devices.
  It also allows for reverse power flow, which means that a device can also
  charge another device or even a battery.
  A microcontroller can be used to control and regulate the charging
  process, in order to implement variable power output.
  PIC microcontrollers (ex.
  Linear Technology’s LTC4055, Texas Instruments’ bq2429x, Maxim
  Integrated’s MAX14526, NXP’s MC3467) are widely used in chargers due to
  their low cost, high performance, and easy-to-use programming.
* *Power requirement*: 10W to 100W.

[[_logistical_requirements]]
=== 3.2. Logistical Requirements
* *Packaging*: The charger should be packaged in a way that ensures it is
  protected from damage.
* *Durability*: Robust design to withstand frequent use and travel.
* *Portability*: For more portability, the LED light segment should be the
  first choice.
* *Labelling*: The charger should be clearly labelled with all relevant
  information, including the output voltage and amperage, safety warnings,
  and the name and contact information of the manufacturer.
* *Compliance*: The charger should comply with all relevant regulations and
  standards regarding storage, handling, and transportation.
  It should also be BIS(Bureau of Indian Standards) approved.
* *Laboratory and Testing*: To test the charger, we need testing equipment
  like DSO, multi-meter, power supply, function generator, and precision
  soldering tools.
  The components need to be tested to prevent breakdown.
* *Manufacturing*: The product has to be manufactured by a third
  manufacturer, or the body gets 3D printed in Lab.
* *Components*: We need step-down transformers, Diodes, capacitors,
  resistors, wires, transistors, and a PIC microcontroller.

[[_environmental_requirements]]
=== 3.3. Environmental Requirements
* *Temperature range*: -10℃ to 60℃.
* *Humidity*: Chargers must be able to operate in a range of humidity
  levels, typically between 20% and 90%.
* *Water resistant*: Charger’s edges and ports need to be rubber sealed, to
  prevent the circuit from water.
* *Altitude*: Chargers must be able to operate at a range of altitudes,
  typically up to 2,000 meters above sea level.
* *Shock and vibration*: Chargers must be able to withstand a certain level
  of shock and vibration without damage or malfunction.
* *EMI/EMC*: Chargers must meet electromagnetic interference (EMI) and
  electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards to ensure that they do not
  interfere with other electronic devices.
* *Safety Standards*: Chargers must meet safety standards to ensure that
  they do not pose a risk of fire or electric shock.
* *Energy efficiency*: Chargers must meet energy efficiency standards to
  minimize energy consumption and reduce environmental impact.
  Minimize No Load power consumption.

[[_structural_requirements]]
=== 3.4. Structural Requirements
* *Dimensions:* The Dimensions of the charger should be around
  (6cm*6cm*4cm).
* *Plug Type:* The charger should be *2-pin plug(Type C)* (2-pin plugs are
  widely used in India, but it is important to make sure it is BIS approved
  for safety and compliance)
* *Material and Design:* The *material* and design of the charger should be
  such that it should be able to withstand a fall from a height of 2m or
  less.
  Some people like to keep their mobile phones on top of the charger so
  adequate design changes should be made to the adapter.
  Also, we now need to make sure that the heat generated in the charger
  shouldn’t be transferred to the mobile phone, in that case, the material
  chosen should have better insulation properties than a standard one.
  For this polycarbonate, casing seems to be the best considering price,
  drop strength, and weight.
* *Adapter-cable joint:* The adapter-cable joint is made to disconnect when
  a jerk is applied quickly but to remain firmly attached otherwise,
  protecting the phone from damage during tripping.
* *Length of cable:* The length of the cable should range from 3 to 4 feet.
  The cable should be tangle free.
* *Wire thickness:* The wire in it should be thick enough to work at 65 W
  but not more than that.
  It should also have the option for sending data from computer to phone and
  vice versa(data cable).
  It should be durable enough such that even if someone treads on it, it
  remains safe and should also withstand a load of minimum 150N.
  It should be a USB 3.X cable with USB C type connector.
  To ensure we can charge a range of devices, it’s best to go with 2A ports
  at minimum.
* *Charger pins:* Pins should be made of a material that has low cost, good
  electrical resistivity, and good wear resistance.
  For this Brass seems to have a mix of all three properties and hence it
  should be used
* *Location of port:* It should be front rather than on the side after
  considering spacing (both in real life and along the board), aesthetics
* *Label Information:* Brand name and logo, Input and output voltage and
  current specifications, Type of connector, Compatibility, Safety
  certifications and standards (e.g., IBS), Product dimensions and weight,
  country of origin, instructions for use and safety precautions Warranty or
  guarantee information.
* *Casing Opening:* The charger case will open from the rear end, keeping
  the area near the pins fixed to ensure easy assembly.
  moreover, the transverse cross-section of the charger will be fixed to
  protect from dust and moisture and structural integrity

[[_features]]
=== 3.5. Features
* *Safety Features*: Over-current, over-voltage, and short-circuit
  protection.
* *Efficient Charging*: Optimised for quick charging of mobile devices.
* *Magnetic Cables*: Materials used for the connector which attaches to the
device’s charging port are made of metals like aluminum or stainless steel,
and the cable itself is usually made up of copper, and the cable jacket is
made of PVC or TPE, the magnets inside the connector are made of neodymium,
samarium cobalt and others that have high magnetic properties at

== 7. System Design
[[_working_mindmap]]
=== 7.1. Circuit Design


-------flowchart

=== 7.1.1. Discarded Designs

=== 7.1.1.1. Design 1
.Schematics of design 1
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/1.png[]

Even Though the above charger reference circuit has specifications like variable output (5V/3A to 20V/3A) , fast charging with USB PD protocol IC, 
The above circuit was a discarded attempt because:

* Due to the fact that IIT D makerspace can only construct single-layered PCBs, the size of the PCB for the above circuit will be fairly huge.
* The BOM(bill of materials) count for the above circuit is extremely high.
* The costs for the individual components are extremely high resulting the manufacturing of the charger will be extremely costly.


=== 7.1.1.2. Design 2
.Schematics of design 2
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/design2.jpg[]

The output of the above circuit is 9V at 3A, and the power supply circuit uses flyback topology. It was a failed attempt because:

* The PCB will be huge (total footprint area = 2534 mm2).
* High cost of manufacturing (cost > 1000 Rupees)
* The output of the above circuit is 9V with a maximum output current of 3A, but only a small number of mobile phones support this charging voltage. Hence, it will harm mobile phones that do not support charging at more than 5V.

=== 7.1.1.3. Design 3

.Schematics of design 3
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/design3.jpg[]
The output for the above circuit is 12V/2A and flyback topology is followed for the power supply circuit. But the above circuit was considered a discarded attempt because:

* The size of the PCB (total footprint area = 2636 mm^2) will be very large because of the same reason the above design was discarded.
*  Expensive fabrication(cost > 1200 Rs)
The output of the above circuit provides only a 12V output voltage with 3A max output current but only a limited number of mobile phones support charging at 12V. Hence charging mobile phones which do not support charging at more than 5V will get damaged.

=== 7.1.1.4. Design 4

.Schematics of design 4
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhruv-2020EE30592/ELP305/main/design4.jpg[]
The output for the above circuit is 9V/3A and flyback topology is followed for the power supply circuit. But it was considered a discarded attempt because:

* The output of the above circuit provides only a 9V output voltage with 3A max output current but only a limited number of mobile phones support charging at 9V. Hence charging mobile phones which do not support charging at more than 5V will get damaged.

We accept 220V AC as input (it can vary between 85-265V) with a frequency between 50-60 Hz and outputting 5V DC.

* From the flowchart, we can see that the input is rectified using a Full Wave Rectifier Bridge IC, which produces an output voltage with a variable DC voltage. The voltage signal is then sent to a Pi-Filter to allow the DC Component and block the AC Component of the Rectifier's output, where the Pi filter is constructed with two 22μF 50 mohm capacitors and a 470 μH 1.48-ohm inductor.

This constant DC voltage is sent to a PWM controller circuit, which converts DC 78.78 kHz high-frequency AC with varying duty cycles for different input voltage and output current.




This high-frequency AC is achieved using an external high voltage switching transistor IPD 80R1K0CE TMA1 driven by a Gate signal provided by the DRV output of the isolated-flyback power-supply controller IC UCC28740. Using an optical coupler, the controller IC provides Constant-Voltage (CV) to improve transient response to large load steps. Primary-Side Regulation (PSR) techniques control Constant-Current (CC). This device processes data from optocoupler feedback and an auxiliary flyback winding for precise, high-performance output voltage and current control.
 
* After getting a high-frequency AC voltage from the PWM oscillator Circuit, this voltage is stepped down to a lower AC voltage using a transformer. The Transformer has three windings: Primary, Secondary, and Auxiliary. The Auxiliary winding is used to run the control circuit. The Secondary winding is connected to a Schottky diode B540C-13-F and a capacitor of 35V and 1.2 mF to convert AC to DC
* The Output of the rectified secondary voltage of the transformer is now connected to a feedback circuit containing an optocoupler PS2711-1  and a low voltage(1.24 V) adjustable precision shunt regulator IC LMV431. An Optocoupler is used for the transmission of feedback signals without contact. It has an infrared LED and a phototransistor. The feedback circuit provides the regulation of output at 5V. A Shunt voltage regulator regulates the voltage by shunting current away from the load to regulate the output voltage. Therefore, the load current becomes more prominent, maintaining the regulated voltage across the load.
